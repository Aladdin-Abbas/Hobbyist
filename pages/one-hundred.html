      <h1>One Hundred Years of Solitude</h1>
      <h2>About the book</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most influential literary works of our time, One Hundred
        Years of Solitude remains a dazzling and original achievement by the
        masterful Gabriel Garcia Marquez, winner of the Nobel Prize in
        Literature. One Hundred Years of Solitude tells the story of the rise
        and fall, birth and death of the mythical town of Macondo through the
        history of the Buendiá family. Inventive, amusing, magnetic, sad and
        alive with unforgettable men and women—brimming with truth, compassion,
        and a lyrical magic that strikes the soul—this novel is a masterpiece in
        the art of fiction.
