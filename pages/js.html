      <h2>About the book</h2>
      <p>
        No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you
        don’t fully understand the language. This concise yet in-depth guide
        takes you inside scope and closures, two core concepts you need to know
        to become a more efficient and effective JavaScript programmer. You’ll
        learn how and why they work, and how an understanding of closures can be
        a powerful part of your development skillset. Like other books in the
        "You Don’t Know JS" series, Scope and Closures dives into trickier parts
        of the language that many JavaScript programmers simply avoid. Armed
        with this knowledge, you can achieve true JavaScript mastery.
